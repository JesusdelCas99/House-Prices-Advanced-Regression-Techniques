# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
This project tackles the Kaggle challenge [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), aiming to predict the sales prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Model Summary
The table below provides an overview of the models developed for this competition:

| Model              | RÂ²      | Leaderboard Score (*) | Training Split Ratio | Validation Split Ratio |
|--------------------|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.91152 | 0.35392           | 0.85                 | 0.15                   |
| Regression Tree    | 0.80361 | 0.23367           | 0.85                 | 0.15                   |

(**\***) Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
